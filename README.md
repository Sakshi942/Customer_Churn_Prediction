# Customer Churn Prediction 📉📊

This project focuses on predicting telecom customer churn using Python, data analysis, and machine learning. By analyzing customer behavior and contract patterns, we aim to help businesses understand why customers leave and how to retain them.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Records**: 7,000+ customer entries
- **Features**: Demographics, contract details, payment methods, tenure, and churn labels

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (EDA & visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values, incorrect data types

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Churn distribution
   - Categorical breakdowns
   - Visual insights using Seaborn/Matplotlib

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - One-hot encoding
   - Feature scaling

4. **Modeling**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - Model evaluation (accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix)

5. **Insights**  
   - High churn with month-to-month contracts  
   - Tenure and charges heavily impact churn rate

---

## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy**: ~80%  
- **Best Model**: Random Forest  
- **Top Features**: Contract type, tenure, monthly charges
